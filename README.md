# Image Captioning with Deep Bidirectional LSTMs

This branch hosts the code for our paper accepted at ACMMM 2016 ["Image Captioning with Deep Bidirectional LSTMs"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00790), to see [Demonstration](https://youtu.be/a0bh9_2LE24). 

### Features 
 - Training with Bidirectional LSTMs
 - Implemented data augmentation: multi-crops, multi-scale, vectical mirroring
 - Variant Bidirectional LSTMs: Bi-F-LSTM, Bi-S-LSTM

### Usage and Example 
 - This work extends ["Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN)"](http://jeffdonahue.com/lrcn/) to bidirectional LSTMs with data augmentation
 - We provide an example [flickr8K](http://nlp.cs.illinois.edu/HockenmaierGroup/8k-pictures.html), in which you can train proposed networks
 - (1) download flickr8 training and test images, and put it to "data/flickr8K/images/", the dataset splits can be found in "data/flickr8K/texts/"
 - (2) create databases with "flickr8K_to_hdf5_data_forward.py" and "flickr8K_to_hdf5_data_backward.py" 
 - (3) train network with "multi_train_Bi_LSTM.sh"
 - (4) perform image caption generation and image-sentence retrieval experiments with "bi_generation_retrieval.py"

# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
